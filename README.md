<h2>What’s in the Value Pack?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Andarine (S4)</strong> – 30 mL at 50 mg/mL (daily dose 50 mg)</li>
  <li><strong>MK‑677 (Ibutamoren)</strong> – 30 mL at 20 mg/mL (daily dose 20 mg)</li>
</ul>
<p>This stack combines a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) with a growth hormone secretagogue. Chemyo bottles are clearly labeled, with batch and purity info on the label. That transparency gave me confidence from day one.</p>

<h2>How I Tested &amp; Ranked This Pack</h2>
<p>I ran a straight 8‑week cycle: 50 mg Andarine each morning, 20 mg MK‑677 before bed. I logged every workout, meal, and sleep hour. I also surveyed a small group of trusted training partners who tried the same cycle at similar dosages.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Week 1–2:</strong> Noticed slight increase in appetite and better sleep quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 3–5:</strong> Strength gains in bench press (+10 lb) and squat (+15 lb). Lean muscle gains of ~2 lb on scale without water retention.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 6–8:</strong> Consistent recovery—no more sore joints. Visible “hardening” of muscles. Fat loss around midsection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on my metrics (strength logs, photos, bodyweight) and partner feedback, I ranked this pack 9.2/10 for overall results.</p>

<h2>Key Benefits I Experienced</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Muscle Hypertrophy:</strong> Noticeable size gains on chest and shoulders.</li>
  <li><strong>Strength Boost:</strong> Added 10–15 lb to major lifts.</li>
  <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Reduced muscle soreness and joint discomfort.</li>
  <li><strong>Sleep Quality:</strong> Deeper REM phases, vivid dreams.</li>
  <li><strong>Bone Density Support:</strong> Andarine’s AR modulator action helps bone health.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Andarine &amp; MK‑677 Work Together</h2>
<p><strong>Andarine (S4)</strong> binds selectively to androgen receptors in muscle and bone. It mimics anabolic effects of testosterone without many androgenic side effects. This means lean muscle growth and improved bone strength. Its half‑life (~4 hours) makes daily dosing easy.</p>
<p><strong>MK‑677 (Ibutamoren)</strong> stimulates growth hormone (GH) and IGF‑1 release. With oral bioavailability near 100%, a single bedtime dose sustained GH spikes overnight. This supports muscle repair, fat oxidation, and better sleep.</p>

<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>High‑quality, transparent labeling</li>
      <li>Synergistic muscle &amp; recovery benefits</li>
      <li>Oral dosing—no injections</li>
      <li>Noticeable strength gains within 3 weeks</li>
      <li>Improved sleep and appetite support</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Slight vision tint (“yellowish” effect) in week 1–2</li>
      <li>Dry mouth from MK‑677—stay hydrated</li>
      <li>Requires PCT if run over 8 weeks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Best For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bulking:</strong> Appetite boost + lean mass gains</li>
  <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Fat oxidation via GH + muscle preservation</li>
  <li><strong>Strength Cycles:</strong> AR modulation for heavier lifts</li>
  <li><strong>Recovery Phases:</strong> Better sleep + joint relief</li>
</ul>

<p>From my point of view, this pack shines in any phase—especially bulking and recovery. If you want to push PRs without excess water weight, this is solid.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Take 50 mg Andarine in the morning on an empty stomach.</li>
  <li>Take 20 mg MK‑677 before bed, 30 minutes before sleep.</li>
  <li>Run the cycle for 8 weeks; follow with a standard SARM PCT.</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated (at least 3 L water daily) and monitor liver enzymes.</li>
</ol>

<p>For best results, combine with a high‑protein diet (1.2–1.5 g per lb bodyweight) and a structured training plan focused on compound lifts.</p>
